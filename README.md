The concept of the algorithm includes the next steps:
  1. Downloading SP500 data.
  2. Dividing the dataset into 3 parts: training, validation and testing.
  3. Comparing 3 types of algorithms: LinearRegression, LinearSVR ,  MLPRegressor. (You can compare more regression algorithms, it depends on your needs)
  4. Developing a pipeline that finds the best parameters for all algorithms.

This example shows the possibility of choosing the best ML algorithm and finding the best parameters for them in automatic mode.
